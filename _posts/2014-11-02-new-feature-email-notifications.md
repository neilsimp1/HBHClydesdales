Now it's even easier to react quickly is issues that pop up with your application. You can now enable a daily digest as well as a *new grouping* notification.

###The daily digest

Each day we'll send you a summary of activity on your Slipspace account. 

The daily digest is split into two sections, **new errors** and **reopened errors**.

The two sections follow the same format, up the top we have a summary of each application, we let you know how many distinct errors occurred over the past 24hrs as well as the total number of occurrences and users affected. Next we give a detailed breakdown of new each error grouping your application encounted.

###New grouping notification

You can also opt in to be notified everytime a new error occurs. This means you can resolve a potential problem when it first happens, rather than when you first check the logs.

###All this is available today

To start receiving the daily digest or *new grouping* notification just head to your profile page and enabled them.
