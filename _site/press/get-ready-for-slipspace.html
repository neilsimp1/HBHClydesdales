<p>####<strong>Get ready for slipspace: new auckland based startup launches its beta programme.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Auckland, NZ, August 10, 2014</strong> - <a href="http://solve.solutions">solve.solutions</a> are proud to announce their first product, <a href="http://slipspace.co">Slipspace</a> - the best way for software services companies to discover, track, and manage software errors automatically.</p>

<p>Slipspace is currently in closed beta and actively looking for strategic partners in the software services industry to help refine the vision for launch. 
The program is filling up fast with only 19 spots left and is open to everyone from freelances all the way up to major practices.</p>

<p>Slipspace is a hosted Software-as-a-Service product that provides error management and other customer-facing tools for software services companies. 
It is designed to be incorporated into existing support processes by being multi-tenanted and white-labelled. White labelling means that each of our customers can brand and host the product under their existing domain.</p>

<p>Slipspace enables support teams to truly excel at their jobs by giving them valuble data which can be filtered to a particular client or application.
“It really introduces a whole new level of transparency to the process. When a client calls up about an error you can let them know when the error first occurred, the number of occurrences, as well as how many people it has affected at the drop of a hat.” said Michael McKenna, founder of solve.solutions. “They [the support staff] can even proactively get in touch with their clients about errors they’ve already fixed under the support agreement, before they become an issue - it’s a game changer” says Michael.</p>

<p>Slipspace gives support a holistic view of all errors across all applications by installing a small component into each application. It then surfaces the information in an easy to use interface which helps them gauge the health of the deployments they’re monitoring. Developers can focus on fixing errors rather than teasing out information from vague bug reports as Slipspace records all the details about the error and groups them automatically. It also offers optional client facing tools so a client can check vital information such as the status of an error before deciding if it’s important enough to call in about.</p>

<p>“Slipspace isn’t aiming to be all things to all people - but at this early stage the app has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from our target market” Michael said.</p>

<p>Slipspace currently supports .NET and JavaScript with additional languages coming soon. There is also a RESTful API which developers can use to add Slipspace support to their framework or language of choice.</p>

<p>Slipspace is scheduled to launch mid-October and is completely free to use while in beta. Pricing to be announced as soon as it becomes available.</p>
