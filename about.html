			HBH Clydesdales has been in business since 1988. The farm was originally
            established in Sand Lake, NY, and in October of 2012 the Clydesdales set up
            their new home in Carlisle, NY.

                    John and Stephanie are dedicated in providing a
                    welcoming environment and an experience you will talk about for years to come.
                    Not only is the farm open 24/7, families are welcome to stop and say hi to the
                    gentle giants. The farm hosts an annual Open House every Columbus Day weekend
                    as well as other events such as the Schoharie County Family Farm Days in
                    August. If you are planning a special event and are looking for rustic country
                    charm or a fairy tale wedding there are wagons and carriages available to make
                    the event complete.
